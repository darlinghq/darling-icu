 * \brief C API: Collator 
 *
 * <h2> Collator C API </h2>
 *
 * The C API for Collator performs locale-sensitive
 * string comparison. You use this service to build
 * searching and sorting routines for natural language text.
 * <em>Important: </em>The ICU collation service has been reimplemented 
 * in order to achieve better performance and UCA compliance. 
 * For details, see the 
 * <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/cvs/icu/~checkout~/icuhtml/design/collation/ICU_collation_design.htm">
 * collation design document</a>.
 * <p>
 * For more information about the collation service see 
 * <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/Collate_Intro.html">the users guide</a>.
 * <p>
 * Collation service provides correct sorting orders for most locales supported in ICU. 
 * If specific data for a locale is not available, the orders eventually falls back
 * to the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr10/">UCA sort order</a>. 
 * <p>
 * Sort ordering may be customized by providing your own set of rules. For more on
 * this subject see the 
 * <a href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/icu/userguide/Collate_Customization.html">
 * Collation customization</a> section of the users guide.
