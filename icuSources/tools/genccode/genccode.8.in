[
.BI "\-d\fP, \fB\-\-destdir" " destination"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B genccode
reads each of the supplied
.I filename
and writes out a C file containing a compilable definition of the data in
the data file.
The C file name is made by taking the base name of the data
.IR filename ,
replacing dots by underscores, and adding a
.I .c
file extension.
.PP
If
.B genccode
is called with no
.I filename
it terminates gracefully.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-h\fP, \fB\-?\fP, \fB\-\-help"
Print help about usage and exit.
.TP
.BI "\-d\fP, \fB\-\-destdir" " destination"
Set the destination directory to
.IR destination .
The default destination directory is the current directory.
.TP
.BI "\-n\fP, \fB\-\-name" " name"
Set the data name to
.I name
instead of the default. This name is also used as the base name of the
output. The default name is made of the
.I icudt
prefix, followed by a two-digit version number corresponding to
the current version of the ICU release, and a single letter indicating
the endianness of the data (the letter
.I b
indicated big endian data, and the letter
.I l
indicates little endian ones).
.TP
.BI "\-e\fP, \fB\-\-entrypoint" " name"
Set the data entry point (used for linking against the data in a
shared library form) to
.IR name .
The default entry point name is made of the data (set by the
.BI "\-n\fP, \fB\-\-name"
option) followed by an underscore and the type of the data (set by the
.BI "\-t\fP, \fB\-\-type"
option).
