This tool is used to automatically generate collation rules for JIS X 4061 sort ordering. It requires ICU to be built beforehand.

The way to use it is to capture the output to a file and then copy and paste it instead of CollationElements section in the Japanese resource bundle.

There is no need for anybody to do that, since this data is already in its proper place. This tool is included for documentation purposes only.
