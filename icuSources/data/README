This directory contains the intermediate, generated ICU data. For example,
.res, .cnv, and some .dat files end up here.

It is also used as a temporary directory by some ICU tools build processes.

You should NOT set your ICU_DATA directory to point here. Instead,
point it to ".." (that is, icu/source/data).
