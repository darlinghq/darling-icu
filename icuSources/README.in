The ICU data files moved!

Depending on the ICU packaging mode, ICU data files were moved to
new locations.

@thelibdir@/@PACKAGE@/@VERSION@

    For the data library (--with-packaging-mode=dll) and individual
    data files (--with-packaging-mode=files).

@thedatadir@/@PACKAGE@/@VERSION@

    For the data common file (--with-packaging-mode=archive).

This move happened post ICU 1.6. The rationale for the move is to be able
to share @thedatadir@ across machines with different architectures, as
it is supposed to be the case.
